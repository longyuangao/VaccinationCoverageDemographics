We also plan to dig deeper into the impact of COVID-19 on the flu vaccination coverage. Through looking at case data, coverage rates, and time series data, we hope to generate conclusions about the state of the flu in the United States and influence policy makers to utilize data-driven decisions to improve the health of communities. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs. In the United States, millions of people contract the flu every year, and a significant number of people die from this disease despite free access to the vaccine. In our research project, we have two aims in regards to flu data. We would first like to establish a background on vaccination coverage rates across the United States, particularly how certain states or regions vary. In combining this with census data, we hope to gain insight into how socioeconomic and demographic factors contribute to these flu statistics. Factors of interest include education, household income, poverty level, and race/age/gender pyramids. We will utilize a variety of geographic map plotting as well as biplot and Cleveland dot plots. The second aim of our research project is to assess the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on vaccination coverage of the flu, considering the social and political tension surrounding the mandatory vaccination. Perhaps the pandemic also affected mortality rates, either due to vaccine hesitancy or confusing flu for COVID-19 or vice versa. We plan to use a variety of time series visualizations to compare pre-2020 (pandemic start year) levels to post-2020. While this aim is not the primary motivation of our project, introducing these time series analyses adds another dimension to our research. Overall, we aim to get a better understanding about the flu vaccination coverage in the United States. By using a variety of data sources and visualization techniques, we hope to tackle multiple perspectives on the status of the flu in this country. 2.2 Data availability Since our project topic mainly focuses on influenza vaccination, among all the data sources, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the most authoritative organizations to gather data. The first dataset we plan to use is the influenza vaccination coverage rates for individuals that are six months or older, provided by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). Here is some information about this dataset: Dataset source URL: CDC Dataset name: Influenza Vaccination Coverage for All Ages (6+ Months) Provider and Owner: National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) Last Updated: October 18, 2022 The data is collected from the National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu), a national wide survey on vaccination coverage conducted by phone, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, another telephone survey. The dataset is recently updated, but the frequency of updates is not clear based on the website. The dataset contains 186,000 records and is organized into 11 columns, including vaccination type, locations of records, time of records, estimates of vaccine coverage, confidence intervals of estimates, etc. According to the website and our own observation, there may be issues regarding the reliability of coverage estimates because sample sizes are sometimes small. The dataset is available in CSV format, importing it into RStudio is straightforward via download and reading. In case there is a need to contact the provider, we can do it directly on the CDC website by sending the provider a message. The second set of datasets we will utilize is national census population and demographics data, including population, gender, education levels, income, etc., by state, which will help discover relationships between influenza vaccination and demographics. Here is some information about this dataset: Dataset source URLs: 1.Census.gov (Population, Age, Gender) 2.Census.gov (Education Attainment) 3.Census.gov (Income) Provider and Owner: United States Census Bureau Update Frequency: 1 year The data is collected by the American Community Survey which is updated annually so that we can observe patterns in any given year or patterns growing across years. The most recent update to the data was 2021. Some potential issues with the datasets are that some margins of error are somewhat wide when doing estimations, and some cells of the dataset are missing which could cause problems when we do data cleaning. These datasets are all available to download in CSV format so that we can directly import them into R, allowing us to combine these demographic data and plot them easily. If there is a question, we can contact the owner by Census.gov. The third and final dataset we plan to introduce is a COVID-19 cases dataset. The intention is to see the impact of COVID on flu vaccination coverages, starting from 2020. Therefore, CDC is again the best choice when looking for health and COVID-related datasets. The dataset we chose focuses on the number of cases and deaths caused by COVID by state/region in a time series format. Here is some information about the dataset: Dataset source URL: CDC Dataset name: United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time Provider and Owner: CDC COVID-19 Response Last Updated: October 20, 2022 This data is collected from local reports. Although this dataset is recently updated, it is archived since CDC decided to stop tracking cases and deaths daily. However, it is enough for our analyses, since we are observing past trends. The dataset contains 60,100 rows and 15 columns. Each row represents the total number of confirmed cases, deaths, probable cases, and other information in a state/region at a given time. According to CDC, it is not possible to gather the exact number of cases or deaths. Therefore, the numbers in this dataset are more or less an estimation. The dataset is available in CSV format. We can directly import it into R and combine it with other datasets since the state/region information is clearly marked in this dataset. In case we have a question, we can send the owner a message on CDC’s website. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.1.1 Flu Vaccine Coverage Dataset Longyuan Gao was primarily responsible for collecting the data within our team. The influenza vaccine coverage data is collected from the CDC, as stated in the previous chapter. The dataset is comprehensive in the sense that it records the coverage rate for every state and region in the United States. Although there is some missing data (June coverage data, for example), the overall quality is adequate for us to conduct visualizations. The data is collected from the National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu), a national wide survey on vaccination coverage conducted by phone, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which is another telephone survey. To obtain the CSV file, we downloaded it from the webpage. Here is some basic information about this dataset: Variables: vaccine type, geography(state/county/region, corresponding name, and a FIPS number), season(year), month, dimension(type(age/ethnicity), metric(&gt;6 year, e.g.)), estimated coverage, sample size, and CI. Number of records: roughly 185,000 Problems: There are certain time periods where data is completely missing (like June 2021), and all the cells are in character form rather than numeric form. This will require some data transformation. 3.1.2 Demographic Datasets For demographics data, we utilized all three nationwide census datasets (population, education attainment, and income) listed in the previous chapter. The census data come from 2021, just like the flu shot dataset. Thus, we can compare flu vaccine coverage rate with demographic information in the same time frame. It is collected by the annual American Community Survey conducted by Census Bureau. The data is available for download right on the webpage. Here is some basic information about these datasets: Variables and number of records: Education attainment: age groups by education attainment (for example, high school degree for people &gt;25), race groups by education, poverty rate, median earnings, etc. This dataset is not tidy, so we are to decide which metrics are variables.There is about 1 observation for each state. Population: similar to the education dataset, it is not tidy. Variables are age groups (&lt;5, 5-9, etc.), selected age categories, statistical summaries, etc., and about 1 observation for each state. Income: total population in that state, income ranges, median, mean, etc., about 1 observation for each state. Problems: All of these datasets store variables in character form, so we have to spend time transforming these characters to numeric. Also, these datasets are in a nested column form, meaning that there are columns within a column if we view them in software like Excel. This poses a challenge for cleaning as well. Moreover, there are so many variables that we do not need, so we also need to deal with the extraneous columns. 3.1.3 COVID-19 Cases Dataset For the COVID-19 cases data, I again downloaded it from the CDC website, as documented above. The dataset starts in 2020 and ends in 2022 which overlaps the flu shots data in the years 2020 and 2021, giving us the opportunity to visualize some trends in COVID cases and flu shots in the same time frame. The data is collected by local reports and is available for downloading online. Variables: submission date, state, total number of cases, total probable cases, total confirmed cases, number of new cases, number of new probable cases, total number of deaths, total number of confirmed deaths Number of Records: roughly 60,100 Problems: There are many variables that are unnecessary for our analyses. Thus, we have to select relevant columns before we conduct the analysis. Many cells have NA values and 0s which lead to a sparse dataset. 3.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation 3.2.1 Flu Vaccine Coverage Dataset First, we extracted the year of the record from the season column, since the number after year in that column is not the month. Then we combine the year with month in the month column, convert it to a date type and store it in a new column called “ym”. Also, we convert the column Estimate (the estimated coverage rate) from character to numeric. 3.2.2 Demographic Datasets For these datasets, we transform them more or less in the same way. First, we only kept columns (which contain data for each state) with estimated values for each state, and transpose the dataset so that each row contains the metrics for only one state. Then, we changed the row names to the exact name of that state and converted the entries to numeric types. For education, we add a column called “high_school_higher_pop” that represents the total population that counts the number of people that attained at least a high school diploma or equivalent education. For population, we add 3 columns, “children_pop”, which counts the number of people 14 and under, “children_ratio”, the ratio of children with respect to the total population, and “elder_ratio”, the ratio of people 65 or older with respect to total population. For income, we only keep the income data for households (this is the majority of the data), and we calculate the ratio of households who earn less than 14,999 dollars/year (stored in household_poverty_rate) or more than 150,000 dollars/year (stored in household_wealth_rate). 3.2.3 demo_df, an Enhanced Dataframe After performing the above transformations, we combined the derived and some raw columns to create the demographics dataset with the flu shot coverage data and form a more concise data frame called “demo_df”. We did further feature engineering in this data frame. To be more specific, this new data frame includes the by-state information on number of people who attained at least a high school or equivalent degree population over 18 ratio of population over 18 that received at least a high school or equivalent degree (engineered by dividing 1 by 2) total population population under 14 ratio of children (&lt;=14) population over 65 ratio of people &gt;=65 median household income mean household income household poverty rate household wealth rate The reason for doing this is that the original datasets are too cumbersome for us to work with. 3.2.4 us_by_year, an Enhanced Dataframe This data frame is extracted from the flu shot dataset. In this data frame, we only keep the records for nationwide flu coverage for each month (2009 to 2021) and only records that are related to seasonal influenza, since H1N1 vaccines are only provided in earlier years. We also only care about the age metric, which should be “&gt;6” months which includes all eligible individuals. Again, the reason we extract this specific data frame is to eliminate unnecessary entries for easier plotting, while keeping the original data frame the same in case we need to gather other data from it. 3.3 Missing value analysis Here we use the naniar package to visualize. 3.3.1 Flu Vaccination Data From the plot, we can see that some rows are missing sample size variables, but since that variable is not taken into consideration, we are not concerned with that variable being NA. Also, some rows are missing Estimate which is, however, valuable to us. For rows with missing Estimates, we decided not to impute them, since we cannot be sure what variables it is dependent on. Some rows are also missing estimates and sample sizes together (maybe because that record is completely missing). Other than the missing columns shown in the graph, we are also observing that some rows are missing, such as all the June data mentioned before which is completely missing without a note. This may be caused by the “reset” of vaccine contents in June of each year. Also, some earlier data contains vaccine coverage data for Asians and Native Americans, but that kind of information is missing in more current data. Thus, we are careful when dealing with this in the dataset: we regularly check if there is missing data in our derived data frame or abnormalities in the plot. 3.3.2 Demographic datasets 3.3.2.1 Population dataset Since visualizations for the whole dataset is unhelpful and somewhat meaningless (there are so many columns, and some columns are intended to be NA), we only visualize the missing values on the subsets of the datasets which are used in our analyses. There are no missing values in relevant subsets of the population dataset. 3.3.2.2 Education attaiment dataset There are no missing values in relevant subsets of the education dataset. 3.3.2.3 Household income dataset There are no missing values in relevant subsets of the household income dataset. Note here that the data for nationwide data is missing, but that doesn’t matter to our analysis, since we will truncate all nationwide data. 3.3.3 COVID-19 cases dataset We can observe that the most missing pattern is conf_cases(confirmed cases), prob_cases (total probable cases), conf_death (confirmed deaths), and prob_death. This can be caused by missing all reports for a certain day. The second most frequent missing pattern is conf_death and prob_death which both focus on the death count. The third most missing pattern is conf_cases and prob_cases, which is a similar situation as the second pattern. There are also about 3400 rows that are missing all confirmed and probable case and death counts. Other than these observable patterns, there are a few rows that have their own specific missing patterns, which may be caused by record errors. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Geographical Patterns 4.2 Flu Vaccination Coverage Time Series Patterns 4.3 Demographic Patterns 4.4 COVID Cases vs. Flu Vaccination Coverage: Time Series Comparison", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Geographical Patterns First, we created a choropleth map using color to indicate the value of flu vaccine coverage rate within United States by state for 2021 and check if there exist some geographical patterns for the distribution of flu vaccine coverage rate. We noticed that the areas with high vaccine coverage are mainly in the Midwest, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. According to a CDC report, flu season usually occurs in the fall and winter in the United States. While influenza viruses spread year-round, most of the time flu activity peaks are between December and February. Thus, low temperatures could be accompanied by high rates of flu infection and thus vaccine coverage rate. Looking at the US map above, Midwest states such as Colorado are located near the Rocky Mountains, with high altitude and low temperatures. The north has a high latitude and a lower temperature than the south. Due to factors such as ocean current and monsoon, the climate in the east is quite different from that in the west coast, and the temperature is relatively lower. Therefore, these regions have relatively higher coverage of flu vaccine. Thus, it appears that the distribution of flu vaccine coverage does have a geographical pattern. Another explanation for this pattern could be patterns of political history. Southern states, leaning more right on the political spectrum, may be less inclined to get a flu shot, whereas Northeast states that tend to vote more liberally would do otherwise, which supports the distribution of coverage we see. We will continue to explore these geographic trends as our analysis continues. 4.2 Flu Vaccination Coverage Time Series Patterns Next, we performed a time series analysis on nationwide flu vaccination coverage from 2009 to 2022 using the clean us_by_year data mentioned in the data section. Notice that the flu vaccination coverage dataset gives the cumulative flu shot coverage from last July or August. For example, the coverage rate in March 2021 is the overall coverage rate from July 2020 to March 2021. Also notice that the content of seasonal influenza changes every year, so every year there is a sudden drop in coverage rate (probably in June). We presume the lack of June data indicates a “reset” of the vaccine during the summer, where the new vaccine is developed for the upcoming winter’s flu strain. The red line in Figure A below shows the highest coverage rate of that year. Based on the above two plots, one can observe that the overall trend of nationwide flu vaccination coverage rate is increasing (the red line follows the overall coverage rate of each year), from about 42% in 2009 to about 52% in 2021. Notice there is a conspicuous drop in 2017 which could be explained by a report by the University of Minnesota. This states that a severe flu season the previous year caused a drop in vaccine coverage, perhaps due to distrust in vaccines. After 2017, we notice a more or less remarkable increase in flu vaccination rate. We will zoom into the 2018-2022 range in later sections to explore its potential correlations with the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking of the patterns for each year, from July or August the coverage rate quickly increases (concave up), and then slowly decreases (concave down) from about December to April of the next year which matches our intuition: those who want to receive flu shots will do it as soon as the new flu shot is released, and fewer people will take flu shots before a new type of flu shot will come out in May or June. 4.3 Demographic Patterns Next, we will relate flu vaccination coverage rates to demographic data. 4.3.1 Race and Age Groups: 2021 We will look at the 2021 data (the latest flu data we have). We plot flu vaccination coverage rates with respect to race groups and age groups. For race groups, we see that in 2021, the white race group has the highest flu vaccination coverage rate, reaching about 53%. The group of other races (unfortunately we cannot be more specific about which races it contains due to the limitation of the dataset) is the second most covered group, also reaching over 50%. The Hispanic race group is the second least covered group, with coverage rate about 44%, and the Black race group is the least covered group, with coverage rate a little less than the Hispanic race group. This kind of pattern of flu coverage with respect to race groups may be intertwined with other socioeconomic phenomena and issues of healthcare access. If we use &gt;=6 months as a baseline group, we can see that the older the age group is, the less coverage rate that group receives. Age groups with 13-17 years old and 18-64 years old are below the baseline coverage rates, and the coverage rates for 6 months-4 years old and 5-12 years old groups are well above the baseline group coverage rate. We notice that children receive more flu vaccine coverage (reaching about 64%) than teenagers and adults, and that is probably due to the fact that children are more susceptible to seasonal influenza, as stated in this article. Therefore, parents might be more likely to force their children to receive the vaccine for protection. 4.3.2 Races and Age Groups: A Time Series Analysis We performed a time series analysis from 2009 to 2021 in race and age groups to see if there exist abnomalities similar to what we see in Simpson’s Paradox. We see that these race groups follow the same trend as the overall population, as we see in previous sections. We can observe that there are drops in flu vaccination coverage rates in the year 2017 in all four race groups as well. Notice that for the White, Non-Hispanic group, the rebound (increase) after 2017 is stronger than other race groups (the rebound is about 13%, from ~42% in 2017 to ~55% in 2020). For Other or Multiple Races, the rebound is not as strong as the white race group. For Hispanic and Black race group, the rebound is even weaker; for the Hispanic race group, we can hardly see a pronounced increase in coverage rate post-2017 as compared to pre-2017. However, these conclusions are only due to visual inspection; we would like to perform some statistical analyses to justify these claims. The age groups time series pattern also follows the general pattern discussed before; moreover, it follows the 2021 age group pattern. Generally speaking, the older ages the group contains, the lower the flu rate coverage rate is over the years. A pronounced point in these plots is that for 13-17 years group, the coverage rate is equal to or even lower than the 18-64 years group in 2010, but it increases in the following years and exceeds the coverage rate for 18-64 years group. 4.3.3 Socioeconomic Data: Finding Important Factors with Biplots Next, we drew a biplot based on selected features from demo_df, demographic information in 2021 introduced in the data section, to examine correlations between demographic features and flu vaccination coverage. Variable names are included on their respective axes. Angles between vectors in biplots tell us about correlations. From this biplot, we can observe that flu shot coverage in 2021 is mostly correlated to the high school education attainment rate in states. Since the household poverty rate forms a large angle with flu shot coverage rate, it is (relatively strongly) negatively correlated with flu shot coverage in 2021. Notice that child_ratio is also similarly negatively correlated with flu shot coverage, but we decided to experiment more on household poverty rate in the next section because there are more states that lie near the household poverty rate axis. Household poverty rate and household wealth rate/median household income have opposite vector axes which matches our intuition about what these variables indicate. We can also observe state clusters in this graph: states like New Mexico, Alabama, and Kentucky lies at the negative flu shot coverage axis and positive household poverty rate axis, indicating that these states associated with high household poverty rate have less flu vaccination coverage. Other states like Mississippi and Louisiana are more extreme in these variables. States like Colorado, New Jersey, and Hawaii lies at the positive axis of coverage and negative axis of household poverty rate, meaning these states have low poverty rate and high flu vaccinations coverage in 2021. A few interesting outliers exist as well like Utah and West Virginia which fall far away from clusters. In conclusion, we sort out two of the most important factors that are correlated, one positively (high school education attainment rate) and one negatively (household poverty rate), to flu vaccination coverage in 2021. Next, we will plot these two factors alongside flu vaccination coverage in 2021 to better illustrate the pattern. We also start to see some geographic patterns emerge that match what we found in earlier and what we will explore with our interactive graphic. For example, many Northeast states are found in the lower right quadrant, where coverage is high and poverty is low. 4.3.4 Cleveland Dotplot of Most Important Factors We used “demo_df” to plot the two factors mentioned above, with data normalized for better visualization. As flu vaccination coverage rate increases, we see a decreasing pattern in the household poverty rate, or the blue dots; we can also see an increasing pattern in high school education attainment rate, or the orange dots. This confirms our conclusion made in the previous section. We will further explore this conclusion in our interactive component. 4.4 COVID Cases vs. Flu Vaccination Coverage: Time Series Comparison A secondary aim of our research was to compare new COVID cases with flu vaccination. Our thought was that flu vaccination coverage might increase after part of the pandemic, due to increased health-related vigilance. First, we plotted nationwide new COVID cases time series from January 2020 to December 2021. We also plotted nationwide flu vaccination coverage rates from January 2018 to December 2021, the same time frame to allow for direct comparison. We observed that the vaccine coverage rate changes every year as a cycle. Each cycle records the cumulative data from June of each year to June of next year. We can see in Figure 1 that the number of people infected has increased in waves since 2020. However, this has no significant impact on the flu vaccine coverage which means the changes in data after 2020 are basically the same as before 2020. Therefore, we believe that the occurrence of COVID does not affect people’s choice of whether to vaccinate against flu. We would like to find more data sources relating to COVID to explore how else the pandemic might have affected the choice and decisions of Americans. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 VizHub 5.2 Summary and Takeaways", " Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 VizHub Click Here To See Visualization 5.2 Summary and Takeaways We chose to use D3 to create an interactive scatter plot, observing the relationship between the flu shot coverage rate in 2021 and proportion of high school educated individuals. As mentioned in the previous section, these two variables showed a particularly strong correlation with one another. By visualizing these on a scatterplot, we can see how all 50 states plus D.C. compare to one another, and coloring by region emphasizes geographic trends. There are two interactive components to this graph. Upon hovering over a given point, that point’s region will be highlighted across the graph, so the viewer can see how states within the same region match up across these variables. The second interactive component allows for deeper data analysis; upon clicking a given point, the name of that point’s state will print next to the point. This allows the viewer to identify outliers or specific points of interest with ease. The highlighting feature of this graphic gives us the strongest visualization to emphasize the geographic clustering of variables. The scatterplot points indicate a general upward, positive trend. The South region occupies many of the points with lower high school education rates and lower flu shot coverage rates, whereas the Northeast region occupies many of the higher education and coverage rate points. Although we identified similar trends when exploring our static plots in the previous section, this D3 graphic was critical in solidifying our arguments and conclusions. Another feature we would like to add to this graphic is an option for the user to select which variables are displayed on the scatterplot. Using a dropdown menu, users can view any pair of demographic, socioeconomic, or coverage variables with auto-adjusting axes. Another graphic that would pair well with this is an interactive choropleth map that could display these variables with a tooltip. We tried this approach but struggled when it came to creating buttons to choose which variable is displayed on the choropleth. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion In this project, we used data from CDC and Census.gov to analyze the relationship between demographical information and flu vaccination coverage in the United States, and we also provided some insights into the influence of the COVID pandemic on flu vaccine coverage. We started with analyzing geographical patterns of flu vaccination coverage in 2021, which is the latest data we have. We drew a choropleth and found that the areas with high vaccine coverage are mainly in the Midwest, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, which may be caused by climate variations between regions. Then we analyzed the time series data considering the nationwide flu vaccination coverage rate from 2009 to 2021, along with some chosen racial groups or age groups. We found that the general pattern of flu vaccination coverage is increasing with an exception in 2017. We also found there are certain patterns associated with racial groups and age groups, such as that children have the largest vaccination coverage, and that white racial group has the largest vaccination coverage. Next, we compared the 2021 flu vaccination coverage data with more state demographical information like income, population composition, and education attainment. From here we found a very important factor that is highly correlated to flu coverage rate, which is the high school degree attainment rate. We did more visualizations based on our key findings. Last but not least, we plotted the flu vaccination coverage data with COVID-19 cases data and found nearly correlation between them, which is a little bit surprising to us because initially we thought the pandemic can potentially increase the flu vaccination rate due to mandates. Admittedly, there are limitations to our project. First, there are data source limitations. For example, in doing the age group analysis, we should make the age bins more or less equal, but the source does not allow us to do this. Second, there are project size limitations. We can add more features in multidimensional analysis (biplots), but even if we included only 3 datasets for that part, it exceeds the recommended datasets amount (about 2, as we are suggested to draw 2 plots for missing value analysis). We also learned a lot about data visualization process from this project. Obviously, we consolidated our coding abilities in R. We also consolidated our sense of what is a “good” graph for a reader, like what color theme we should use, or what order of variables we should adopt. In a more general sense, we became more careful in examining datasets and more experienced in transforming a raw dataset into a clean dataset for plotting. For example, in the beginning, we did not figure out what the “Dimension” means in the flu vaccination coverage dataset from the CDC means, so we did not know that the dataset actually includes racial/age categories until some of the group members point out. In the future, we will probably spend more time finding good data sources that suit our needs well, and we will definitely read the column descriptions before working on data cleaning and transformation. We will also try to combine more possible datasets in multidimensional analysis, if possible.
